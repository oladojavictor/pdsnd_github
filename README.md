### Project Title
US_Bikeshare_Data

### Description
I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
