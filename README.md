### Project Title
US_Bikeshare_Data

### Description
I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
I use [chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qw1F7XjyKeH_CYVf7_B89Fhm68WqIMTg?usp=sharing)
